# Law_and_Literature

I teach Law & Literature and Law & Storytelling at the University of Nebraska College of Law, 
and this is a public repository of some files I use. 

* [My University of Nebraska College of Law page](http://law.unl.edu/richard-dooling#about).
* [My Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dooling).
* [One sorely neglected blog](http://dooling.com).
* [Twitter @RichardDooling](http://twitter.com/richarddooling).

Eventually we'll post our reading list for the year, 
but for now, short notes and essays are located here. 

### Files & Folders

You don't need to know Markdown or computer programming to use or view these files. 
Public repositories (like this one) can be browsed 
and the files can be downloaded by anyone. 
If you are a student looking to download or view the Law & Storytelling files, 
just find the files you want and download them.

Each folder contains three files, all named after the folder:

* one Markdown file (.md)
* one Word file (.docx)
* one PDF file (.pdf)

All files contain the same content, just in different formats. For example, the [Intro folder](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Law_and_Literature/tree/master/Intro) contains three files:

* Law_and_Storytelling_Intro.md
* Law_and_Storytelling_Intro.docx
* Law_and_Storytelling_Intro.pdf

If you click on the Markdown file (Law_and_Storytelling_intro.md) you can view it as you would a web page. 

If you click on the Chapter_1.docx or Chapter_1.pdf, you can't view the files, but you can download them if you click on the button that says "Raw." (Clicking on "View Raw" gives an error.)

### Download Zip

If you would like to download ALL of the files in this repository, look for the two buttons at the bottom of the right sidebar: "Clone in Desktop" and "Download Zip".

If you click on the "Download Zip" button, you will download a zip file containing all the files in this repository. Probably not so bad at first, but over the course of the semester more files will be added. You'll have a version problem, which is why Git and GitHub were invented. 

### Cloning

Consider investing a little time and learning how to "clone" the entire repository in your desktop. If you click on "Clone in Desktop" you will download the GitHub program, and you will be asked to create a free GitHub account. Using a simple GitHub app you will be able to quickly fetch the latest versions of these files to your computer using a simple free application available at [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

#### Typos, Glitches

If you spot a typo or formatting glitch please [submit an issue](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Law_and_Literature/issues).

On the [Law and Literature repository page](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Law_and_Literature), on the right, click on the "Issues" link and describe the problem. If need be, copy in text illustrating the problem.

Issues are easy to submit, and you'll be making the text better for those who come after you.

Thank you,
