# Law & Storytelling

The questions and commentaries on the *Preamble* and the *Declaration* are excerpts from [When Words Lose Their Meaning](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo5967304.html), by [James Boyd White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Boyd_White), and my edits and additions to [Professor Craig Lawson's](http://law.unl.edu/craig-m-lawson/) Handout for his Law & Literature class. 

## Law AS Literature: The Preamble

How do statutes declare and describe the laws of the land? 
Why do some novels make us laugh, and others make us cry?
How does a passage of prose WORK? What does it convey?
Consider this familiar paragraph of a law.
First and foremost, it is a writing. 
But a paragraph so well-wrought that it begs to be read aloud:

> WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, in Order to form a more perfect
> Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the
> common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings
> of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish
> this Constitution for the United States of America.

> *The Constitution of The United States*, 1787

How does the *Preamble* work? This is a question of interpretation. 
Readers, lawyers, literary critics, they all interpret prose.
So be a reader and critique the *Preamble*. 
Give an account of its meaning. 

If it is great literature probably none of us can improve upon it or shorten it. 
But see if you can explain its literary music---
its tone, rhythm, diction, syntax, figures of speech, and
other literary characteristics. 
Are these tools of the writing trade or just attributes of great prose? 
How does the *Preamble* work? 

If this seems like too vague a job, 
try answering the following specific questions. 

#### Your First Impressions As Readers

What is your first impression of the Preamble's meaning? 
Your first impression of its function in the Constitution?

#### Literal Meaning

What main action does the Preamble describe? 
(Who or what is the subject of the Preamble? 
What is the subject doing in the action which the Preamble describes?)

#### Identity of the Subject

What person is the Preamble written in? 
(first person---I or we; second person---you; or third person---he, she, it, or they?) 
Does it matter? Rewrite the Preamble in another person; 
try for example, by starting with "This constitution.&hellip;" 
How does that change the Preamble's [connotative][] and [denotative][] force?

[connotative]:	http://literarydevices.net/connotation/ "Defn. connotation"
[denotative]:	http://literarydevices.net/denotation/	"Defn. denotation"

#### Internal Structure

How many words come between the subject of the Preamble and its verb? 
What form does this interruption take? How does it affect the force of the Preamble?

#### Action

What is the main verb in the Preamble? 
Are there other verbs? How many? 
How do they function in the Preamble?

#### Tone

What is the overall tone or mood of the preamble? 
How does it achieve this tone?

### Reverse Engineering

When you have taken apart the *Preamble* 
and considered these questions. Reassemble and consider again the questions above. 
What do you think of its overall literary force? 
Is it a work of great literature? What does it mean? 
Does this seem consistent with its legal function 
as a clause at the beginning of the United States Constitution?

Our interpretive investigation of the *Preamble* is an exercise in the
Law *as* Literature---the study of the literary qualities of a legal text.

## The Declaration of Independence

* In Congress, July 4, 1776
* The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America

> When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary 
> for one people to dissolve the political bands 
> which have connected them with another,
> and to assume among the powers of the earth, 
> the separate and equal station 
> to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, 
> a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires 
> that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

Who is speaking? Whose voice is it? Is it a person's voice? A
committee's voice? No, it is the unanimous voice of the "thirteen United
States" and their people.

Who is the audience? Britain? The citizens of the United States? Talking
out loud to themselves? No. The audience is UNIVERSAL. No less than
mankind itself. Not located in space or time. This “voice purports to
know about “the course of human events” and to discern what “becomes
necessary.” The voice speaks to 18th Century assumptions about the
universal character of human nature and experience.

Voice is removed from passion and particular circumstances and is
therefore almost mild. As one commentator (Stuart Tave) put it: the
“diction is as little violent as it can be.”

*Dissolve the bands*---not burst asunder the hoops of steel. Not
throwing off the chains of tyranny, not shattering the manacles of
slavery, instead: a reassuring statement of simple fact. The
“separation” was not chosen but instead it was made “necessary,”
“impelled by certain causes”---as the Declaration itself is not chosen but
“required.”

It simply “declares” that certain “causes” have produced certain
effects, and it does so with no more passionate motive than a “decent
respect to the opinions of mankind.”

We the audience are to learn the “causes of the separation” and then to
maintain a good opinion of the authors. Very mild. High-minded and
genteel. 

Are we being seduced?

In fact, the audience cannot be MANKIND, for whoever reads the
Declaration will be English, French, or American. To the foreigner:
it is a claim of maturity. To the Englishman: a performance of
reasonableness that undermines the view of the American as uncivilized
and uncouth. To the American Royalist: it makes a switch of sides
more possible. To the patriot offers something to reassure his
critics. And to the undecided American: it is an appeal to join a
community.

Look at the structure of the sentence: before the main clause “they
should declare &hellip; ” there is a LONG SUBORDINATE CLAUSE. Principles of
composition would suggest that this subordinate clause is of secondary
importance. The reader slides through waiting for a subject and a verb
and a main clause, but when the reader finally gets there, he finds that
he has acquiesced in an astonishing set of propositions. In fact the
CENTRAL propositions that the Declaration is intended to establish. That
America is “one people”, that “necessity” can justify a unilateral
separation and that, once separated this people is entitled by by law,
by nature and by God to an equal station among nations. Fervor: “The
Laws of Nature and Nature’s God” But it is checked by “a decent respect.
Instead of directly addressing these things IT ASSUMES THEM AWAY.

The next paragraph upsets these expectations by affirming and bringing
to our attention the central tenets:

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

> That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men,
deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, 

> That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is
the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its
powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments
long established should not be changed for light and transient causes;
and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more
disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long
train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object
evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide
new Guards for their future security.

> Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now
the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of
Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a
history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To
prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. 

> He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public
good. 

> He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and
pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent
should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to
attend to them. 

> He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation
of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the
right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them
and formidable to tyrants only. 

> He has called together legislative
bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository
of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into
compliance with his measures. 

> He has dissolved Representative Houses
repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights
of the people. 

> He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions,
to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable
of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their
exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the
dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. 

> He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. 

> He has obstructed the Administration of
Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary
powers. 

> He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure
of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. 

> He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers
to harass our people, and eat out their substance. 

> He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies, without the Consent of our
legislatures. 

> He has affected to render the Military independent of and
superior to the Civil power. 

> He has combined with others to subject us
to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our
laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: 

> For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: 

> For protecting them,
by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should
commit on the Inhabitants of these States: 

> For cutting off our Trade
with all parts of the world: 

> For imposing Taxes on us without our
Consent: 

> For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by
Jury: 

> For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended
offences: 

> For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a
neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and
enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit
instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

> For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and
altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: 

> For suspending our
own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to
legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. 

> He has abdicated Government
here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

> He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and
destroyed the lives of our people. 

> He is at this time transporting
large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death,
desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &
perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally
unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. 

> He has constrained our fellow
Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their
Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to
fall themselves by their Hands. 

> He has excited domestic insurrections
amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our
frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is
an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In
every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the
most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by
repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act
which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have
warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend
an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the
circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to
their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the
ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would
inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have
been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must,
therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation,
and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace
Friends.

> WE, THEREFORE, the REPRESENTATIVES of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in
General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world
for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority
of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That
these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be FREE AND INDEPENDENT
STATES; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,
and that all political connection between them and the State of Great
Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and
Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace,
contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and
Things which Independent States may of right do. ---And for the support of
this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine
Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and
our sacred Honor.
